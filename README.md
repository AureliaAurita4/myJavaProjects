Project: 'Evening Notes'
What helps you feel happy and concious every day?
They say to fully enjoy life we need to recall continuously the happy moments of a day and stay in touch with our inner self.
For this reason it has been decided to create a program called 'Evening Notes'.
With its help the delights, difficulty, and feelings can be easily recorded.
The notes are further accessble from a distinct file.
